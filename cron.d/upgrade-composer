# Upgrade Composer at 12am
# Fri 18 May 2018 - Dave changed to 7am because we're still getting this error on a regular basis:
#   [Composer\Downloader\TransportException]
#   The "https://getcomposer.org/versions" file could not be downloaded: SSL: Connection reset by peer
#   Failed to enable crypto
#   failed to open stream: operation failed
# But it seems to work fine when I run it during the day, and it works some days not others!
